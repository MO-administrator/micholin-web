> It’s rare that you come across standout talent like Olin.
> I had the pleasure of working with Olin for two years at the Efurtherance, collaborating on several internal projects.
> Olin's ability to juggle multiple projects weather it be company-wide configuration and installation of WIFI, Firewall, Switches, etc. in our new office in a very short deadline, or helping configure/troubleshoot technical issues for our new hires was unlike any I’ve seen before and made a dramatic difference in the productivity level of the company.
> Olin has an extremely likable personality who is humble and eager to learn which can be seen throughout his career progression.
As as team member or a leader, Olin earns my highest recommendation and I strongly believe that Olin would be an asset to any team.
