# [Milind Satam][linkedIn]

> Olin used to work with me at Efurtherance. He was Network and System specialist. My very first memory of him is when our then CEO told him you are hired, next minute he was under the table fixing the computer. Sincerity and dedication at best.

> But being in network and hardware field never stopped him from studying other domains. He was constantly learning. HTML, CSS, building websites, node JS, PHP etc.

> At his work, he was always very supportive and excellent, well-spoken, and sometimes witty! :-)

> I will happily recommend him to any organization out there.
