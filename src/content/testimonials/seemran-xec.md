> I had the pleasure of working with Olin for a year at the Ninestack Company, who showcases good skills in whatever he does. We have collaborated on several projects. I was particularly impressed by Olin's competence to pick up new technologies and how well he grasped them in a short period of time, not to forget the amount of coffee he can consume. Olin is a great asset to any team!
