# [Christabel Pereira][linkedIn]

> It's rare to come across people with real talent and skill. Olin is one of them!

> I had the pleasure of working with Olin a couple of years ago at Hutchinson 3G. He displayed passion and a deep understanding of technical skill required for the job. He dealt with even the toughest clients effortlessly. That skill often takes years to develop, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to him.
> No matter how stressful a day was, Olin made sure to check in with his colleagues and ensured everyone left with a smile.

> Olin would be an asset to any company!
